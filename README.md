# Image-Segregation-Using-OpenCV
I have crated a program with python and OpenCV's in-built Face Recognition model for segregating my family photos and extract the photos of a particular member in the family.

face_extract.py is for extracting the faces from a set of photos for train purpose.

face_train.py is for training the in built model with each extracted faces.

face_recognizer.py is the main program for segregating the photos based on the input by the user.
